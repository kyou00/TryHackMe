Hey Son

Buddy, Sean left a note on his desk with some really strange writing on it. I quickly wrote
down what it said. Could you look into it please? I think it could be something to do with his
account on here. I want to know what he's hiding from me... I might need a new agent. Pretty
sure he's out to get me. The note said:

was rather odd. Imagine wearing his ugly face.... I wouldnt be
 able to FACE that!!
