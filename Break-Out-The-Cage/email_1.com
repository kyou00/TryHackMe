Hey Cage!

There's rumours of a Face/Off sequel, Face/Off 2 - Face On. It's supposedly only in the
planning stages at the moment. I've put a good word in for you, if you're lucky we 
might be able to get you a part of an angry shop keeping or something? Would you be up
for that, the money would be good and it'd look good on your acting CV.

Regards

Sean Archer
