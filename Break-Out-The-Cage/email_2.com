Dear Sean

We've had this discussion before Sean, I want bigger roles, I'm meant for greater things.
Why aren't you finding roles like Batman, The Little Mermaid(I'd make a great Sebastian!),
the new Home Alone film and why oh why Sean, tell me why Sean. Why did I not get a role in the
new fan made Star Wars films?! There was 3 of them! 3 Sean! I mean yes they were terrible films.
I could of made them great... great Sean.... I think you're missing my true potential.

On a much lighter note thank you for helping me set up my home server, Weston helped too, but
not overally greatly. I gave him some smaller jobs. Whats your username on here? Root?

Yours

Cage
