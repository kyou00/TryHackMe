Why CeWL?
CeWL is a wordlist generator that is unique compared to other tools available. While many tools rely on pre-defined lists or common dictionary attacks, CeWL creates custom wordlists based on web page content. Here's why CeWL stands out:

Target-specific wordlists: CeWL crafts wordlists specifically from the content of a targeted website. This means that the generated list is inherently tailored to the vocabulary and terminology used on that site. Such custom lists can increase the efficiency of brute-forcing tasks.

Depth of search: CeWL can spider a website to a specified depth, thereby extracting words from not just one page but also from linked pages up to the set depth.

Customisable outputs: CeWL provides various options to fine-tune the wordlist, such as setting a minimum word length, removing numbers, and including meta tags. This level of customisation can be advantageous for targeting specific types of credentials or vulnerabilities.

Built-in features: While its primary purpose is wordlist generation, CeWL includes functionalities such as username enumeration from author meta tags and email extraction.

Efficiency: Given its customisability, CeWL can often generate shorter but more relevant word lists than generic ones, making password attacks quicker and more precise.

Integration with other tools: Being command-line based, CeWL can be integrated seamlessly into automated workflows, and its outputs can be directly fed into other cyber security tools.

Actively maintained: CeWL is actively maintained and updated. This means it stays relevant and compatible with contemporary security needs and challenges.
